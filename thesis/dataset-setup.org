* Agents N.
  We should choose the following parameters
  - \(\delta\) - maximum amount of money which can spend the agent;
  - \(\alpha \in \mathbb{R}\) - the /step/ of the strategy (width of the relay);
  - \(\alpha_0 \in (-\alpha, \alpha)\) - the /middle layer/ of the strategy;
  - \(n \in \mathbb{N}_{0}\) - number of layers above middle layer;
  - \(L = L(\delta)\) - number of real agents with this strategy;


  First we should choose \(\delta\). We fix \(\delta_0 > 0, \hat{\delta} > 0, k \in \mathbb{N}\) and consider \(\delta_0\),
  \(\delta_{1} = \delta_{0} + \hat{\delta}, ..., \delta_{k} = \delta_{0} + k\hat{\delta}\). So, we just consider finite sequence of
  \(\delta_{i}\) with fixed step. For each \(\delta_{i}\) we should find \(L(\delta_{i})\). For this purpose we need so-called gamma
  distribution. We take on with \(k = 5, \theta = 5\), multiply it by 10. We set \(L(\delta_{i}) = 10 f_{(5, 4)} (\delta_{i})\)

  Each real agent with strategy corresponding to parameters \(\alpha, \alpha_{0}, n\) is represented by \(2n\) relays with thresholds
  \([\alpha_{0} - n \alpha, \alpha_{0} - (n-1)\alpha], [\alpha_{0} - (n-1) \alpha, \alpha_{0} - (n-2)\alpha], ...
  [\alpha_{0} + (n-1) \alpha, \alpha_{0} + n\alpha]\) (at these layers agent buys/sells his stock). At the beginning agent have \(n\)
  stocks if \(\alpha_0 \ge 0\) and \(n-1\) otherwise.

  We choose \(\alpha\) also using gamma distribution. Take one with \(k = 2, \theta=2\). \(\alpha_0\) we choose using the uniform
  distribution between \(-\alpha\) and \(\alpha\). \(n\) we find as a root of the equation
  \(L(\delta) = \frac{e^{-\alpha}(1 - e^{-\alpha n})}{1-e^{-\alpha}}\). Here we assume that the number of stocks is exponential decline.
  (geometric progression).

* Agents D
  We should choose parameter \(\beta\)( when price rise/drop \beta points we buy/sell) and decide whether agents have stock at the
  very beginning. We consider sequence \(\beta_{i}\) with fixed step. We also fix gamma distribution with some parameters sand multiply
  it by number \(B\). We want to give the same amount of stocks for \(N\) and \(D\). So \(B\) we can found from the equation
  \(\sum_{\alpha, \delta} n (\delta, \alpha) L (\delta) = \sum D_{1} (\beta_{i}) = B \sum_{i} \Gamma(\beta_{i}) \) where \(D_{1}(\beta_{i})\)
  is number of \(D\) agent corresponded to \(beta_{i}\) with stock at the very beginning. We also assume that
  \(D_{0} (\beta_{i}) = D_{1}(\beta_{i})\) where \(D_{0}(\beta_{i})\) is number of D agent corresponded to \(\beta_{i}\) without
  stock at very beginning.

* Note:
  - why should we choose gamma distribution?
    since the probability density function of gamma distribution is in *first quadrant*, and it's continous.

  - why should we assume that the amount of money belonged to people is following to gamma distribution
    it make sense to make this assumption. In reality, most people only possess medium wealth.

  - why should we assume that the width of relay(\(\alpha\)) is following to gamma distribution.
    In reality, most people will have the same strategy to react to the change of stock price.
