\subsection{General hysteretic networks\label{sec:chapter3:general-hysteretic-networks}}
A general network may consist of several play layers (and perhaps standard layers). We can such a network \textsl{hysteretic}, and denote
\begin{equation*}
  p_n = F(X_n, W)
\end{equation*}
where $X_n = (x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ and $w$ is a vector of all weights of the network.
